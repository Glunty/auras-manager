# auras-manager
module for foundryVTT to manually manage aura effects using a dedicated macro

Created for Marshall archetype, but can be improved with others auras if needed.

Ultimately, will be obsolete when foundry will provide an API for Auras (pf2e system devs are waiting for that API to implement auras in pf2e)
